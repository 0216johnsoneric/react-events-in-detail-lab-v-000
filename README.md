# React Mouse Events

## Objectives

1. Describe how we might use mouse events to enhance interactivity
2. Describe how we can attach and use click events
3. Practice using click events

## Overview

We mostly want to test that students understand how to use click event handlers:
where to place them, how to trigger them, when to call what methods on the event
itself.
